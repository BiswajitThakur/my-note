# Modules

modules are a fundamental feature used to structure code into reusable blocks. A module is simply a file that contains related code, which can be functions, variables, objects, or classes. Node.js follows two main module systems:

1. **CommonJS (`js require()` and `module.exports`)** — the traditional system in Node.js.
1. **ESM (ECMAScript Modules) (`import` and `export`)** — the modern JavaScript standard for modules.
