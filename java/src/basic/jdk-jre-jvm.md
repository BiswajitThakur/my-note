# Explain the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM.

- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: It is a software development kit used to develop Java applications. It includes the JRE, an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), and other tools needed for Java development.
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: It provides libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run Java applications. It is the implementation of the JVM and includes the core libraries and other components required to run Java applications.
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: It is an abstract machine that enables your computer to run a Java program. JVM performs three main tasks: loads bytecode, verifies bytecode, and executes bytecode.
